# What are we going to build?

We're going to build a realtime todo app. This is a mildly contrived Todo app with realtime features so that we can cover the most important GraphQL features in a single app.

We're not actually going to build the UI of the app, because our interest is in doing the GraphQL API integration with our app. The learning goals are:

1. How to start working with a GraphQL API
2. Integrating GraphQL queries, mutations, subscriptions
3. Learning about GraphQL query variables & fragments

There are 3 main components to the app we're going to build.

## Basic todo feature

- Insert a todo
- View todos
- Mark a todo as done
- Delete a todo

## Online users

- View other online users

## Realtime todo feed

- Users can create public todos which will appear in a realtime feed
