## Relationships - fetch user info for a todo / fetch all todos by a user (object / array)

## Summary - final queries for different components.

# Mutation

## Mutation using variables.

## Update / Delete todos

# Subscriptions

## How does subscriptions work? websocket / apollo-subscriptions-transport-ws

## Public todos / Online member count

# Adding Authentication
